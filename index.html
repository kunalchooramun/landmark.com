                    <h3>CREDIT FACILITIES</h3>
                    <p>In Mauritius, real estate is one of the safest investments to build a lasting legacy and to protect its financial security. Today, this country allows Mauritians and foreigners to acquire IRS, RES and PDS properties and has several credit facilities to finance a property purchase project. These foreign and Mauritian buyers are turning to the banking sector for a loan or a mortgage.</p>

                    <h3>CREDIT CARD</h3>
                    <p>When you take a cash advance from a credit card to buy a home, you will pay a fee (as high as 5%), but that fee will likely be a lot less than the combined costs of mortgage application fees and closing costs. Once you have the cash advance, you’ll purchase a cashier’s check that you will bring with you to closing</p>
